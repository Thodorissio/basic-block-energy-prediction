# Overview

This is my thesis repo. It aims to predict the energy that a basic block of code will consume based on custom created dataset.

# Basic Dependencies

environment.yml will be uploaded as soon as the major developement has been completed

```
cd code-energy-prediction
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate energy-prediction
```

# To do

* Fix pipeline bug for sentiment analysis
* Test pipeline with basic block data and random sample energy labels

# Contributors

* Siozos Theodoros
