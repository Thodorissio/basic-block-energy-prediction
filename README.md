# Basic Dependencies

Here will be uploaded the conda environment instalation

# To do

* Check if embeddings can be represented in a cosine space so as to fully utilize cosine simil metric
* Run more tests with palm-tree tool
* Create ml-pipeline for embeddings to be trained when the dataset comes
